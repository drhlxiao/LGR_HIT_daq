 Dear Hualin,

I cannot send this batch files by email.
*batm *tar, *zip is not acceptable.
Here is the link:

What we have done is mostly:

init.bat - to initialize device and readout mode
cal_on - to enable pulser
cal_off - to disable pulser
drs_trigger - to send one trigger by command (pedestal)
drs_enable - to enable readout sequencer and start drs
drs_disable - to disable readout sequencer and stop drs
triggers_off - to switch off triggers and trigger patterns

So, to see initialize one can use:
init.bat
triggers_off

If one needs pulser then (if only noise then do not use it):
cal_on

To start DRS and enable rreadout:
drs_enable

Then to generate events:
drs_trigger

To start  disable DRS and readout:
drs_enable


Best, Dominik Rybka

1) take pedestals
init.bat                                (initializing ROI readout mode, 2 channels (0 and 1), 100 samples readout from each channel - this implicates 203 FIFO burst length to be implemented (in registers and in software))
triggers_off
drs_enable
drs_trigger                         (generating one event)
drs_disable

2) to see calibration sinuous waves
init.bat                                (initializing ROI readout mode, 2 channels (0 and 1), 100 samples readout from each channel - this implicates 203 FIFO burst length to be implemented (in registers and in software))
triggers_off
cal_on
drs_enable
drs_trigger                         (generating one event)
drs_disable

3) to record external signals
init.bat                                (initializing ROI readout mode, 2 channels (0 and 1), 100 samples readout from each channel - this implicates 203 FIFO burst length to be implemented (in registers and in software))
!! Hv settings and triggers patterns are to be set but there are not in batch files. One has to play with hv as in Ronny email and triggers are describes in the specification.
drs_enable
!! Events should appear
drs_disable
